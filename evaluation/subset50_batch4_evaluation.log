1. Find a course on Coursera about 'Relativity' for beginners.
2. List the course's main topics.
3. List the estimated time (in hours) required to complete it.

**Result Response and Screenshots:**
- The course found is "Introduction to Mechanics Specialization" by Rice University.
- Main topics listed: motion, forces, energy, momentum, gravitation.
- Estimated time: 2 months at 10 hours/week (about 80 hours).
- The response itself notes: "The course covers foundational physics but does not specifically focus on 'Relativity.' It is a beginner-level introduction to mechanics and related concepts."

**Screenshot Verification:**
- The screenshots confirm the course details as described in the response.
- Nowhere in the course description or topics is "Relativity" (Special or General) mentioned as a focus or even a module.
- The course is about introductory mechanics, not relativity.

**Assessment:**
- The task specifically asked for a course about "Relativity" for beginners.
- The course found is not about relativity, but about general mechanics.
- The response itself acknowledges this shortcoming.

**Conclusion:**
The task has NOT been successfully accomplished because the course found does not meet the primary requirement: it is not about "Relativity." The other details (topics, estimated time) are correct for the course found, but the course itself is not relevant to the instruction.

**Final Verdict: NOT SUCCESS**

Let's break down the requirements and the evidence:

**Task Requirements:**
1. Find daytime only parking nearest to Madison Square Garden.
2. Summarize what people are saying about it.

**Evidence from Screenshots:**
- The search was for "daytime parking" near Madison Square Garden.
- The top results shown are:
  - Meyers Parking (220 W 31st St): 3.6 stars, "Easy in and out parking"
  - Meyers Parking (323-331 W 34th St): 3.1 stars, "The service is good and great employees and the parking price is great."
  - Park N' Lock (228 W 31st St): 4.4 stars, "It's safe and they have affordable pricing."
- All three are very close to Madison Square Garden, as seen on the map.
- The reviews are summarized in the result response, matching the snippets shown in the screenshots.

**Analysis:**
- The response accurately lists the nearest parking options and provides a summary of user feedback, directly quoting the review highlights visible in the screenshots.
- However, the task specifically asks for "daytime only" parking. The listings shown in the screenshots all state "Open 24 hours," which means they are not "daytime only" but rather 24/7. There is no evidence in the screenshots that any of these options are restricted to daytime only.
- The summary of what people are saying is accurate and matches the review snippets.

**Conclusion:**
- The search and summary were performed correctly for parking near Madison Square Garden, and the review summary is accurate.
- However, the specific requirement for "daytime only" parking was not met, as all options shown are open 24 hours and there is no indication of daytime-only restriction.

**Final Verdict:**  
NOT SUCCESS

**Reason:** The parking options provided are not "daytime only" as requested; they are open 24 hours. The summary of reviews is accurate, but the core requirement regarding the type of parking was not fulfilled.

Let's break down the requirements and the evidence:

**Task Instruction:**  
Find the Hugging Face documentation tutorial on loading adapters with PEFT, and explain how to load in 8bit or 4bit.

**Result Response:**  
The response provides code snippets using `BnbQuantizationConfig` and `load_and_quantize_model` to load models in 8bit or 4bit, and claims this is the procedure for efficient inference or adapter use.

**Screenshots Review:**  
- The screenshots show the Hugging Face documentation, specifically the "Model quantization" section under Accelerate.
- The relevant code is visible:
  - For 8bit:
    ```python
    from accelerate.utils import BnbQuantizationConfig
    bnb_quantization_config = BnbQuantizationConfig(load_in_8bit=True)
    ```
  - For 4bit:
    ```python
    from accelerate.utils import BnbQuantizationConfig
    bnb_quantization_config = BnbQuantizationConfig(load_in_4bit=True)
    ```
  - Loading the quantized model:
    ```python
    from accelerate.utils import load_and_quantize_model
    quantized_model = load_and_quantize_model(...)
    ```
- The screenshots confirm that these instructions are present in the official documentation.

**Analysis:**  
- The response accurately reflects the content of the documentation as shown in the screenshots.
- The code and explanation match the Hugging Face documentation for model quantization (8bit/4bit) using Accelerate.
- However, the original instruction specifically asked for "loading adapters with PEFT." The screenshots and the response focus on model quantization with Accelerate, not specifically on PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) or loading adapters.
- There is no explicit mention of PEFT or adapter loading in the screenshots or the response.

**Conclusion:**  
- The response correctly explains how to load models in 8bit or 4bit as per the Hugging Face documentation.
- However, it does not address the "loading adapters with PEFT" part of the instruction. The tutorial and code shown are about quantization, not about PEFT adapters.

**Final Verdict:**  
NOT SUCCESS

**Reason:**  
The response fulfills the quantization part of the instruction but does not address or show how to load adapters with PEFT, which was explicitly requested. The screenshots and response do not mention PEFT or adapter loading.

Let's break down the requirements and check the evidence:

**Task Requirements:**
1. Calculate the mass of Jupiter compared to Earth using Wolfram Alpha.
2. Find the length of one day on Jupiter.

**Result Response:**
- Mass of Jupiter compared to Earth: ~320 times.
- Length of one day on Jupiter: about 9.9 hours (9 hours, 55 minutes, 30 seconds).

**Screenshot Evidence:**

1. **Mass of Jupiter compared to Earth:**
   - Screenshot 5 shows: "≈ 320 × Earth mass (≈ 5.97 × 10^24 kg)" under "Comparison as mass".
   - This matches the response: Jupiter is about 320 times as massive as Earth.

2. **Length of one day on Jupiter:**
   - Screenshot 10 shows: "9.925 hours (sidereal)", "9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds".
   - This matches the response: about 9.9 hours (or 9 hours, 55 minutes, and 30 seconds).

**Process:**
- The screenshots show that the queries were entered separately after the initial combined query was not understood.
- Both required pieces of information were found and are accurately reported in the result response.

**Conclusion:**
Both parts of the task were completed correctly, with the answers directly supported by the screenshots.

**Verdict: SUCCESS**
